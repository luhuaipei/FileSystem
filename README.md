# FileSystem
 A read-only driver for ext2.

In this project, you will implement a read-only driver for ext2, a standard filesystem supported by the Linux kernel. Starting from a reference implementation provided in binary form, you will reimplement the driver one piece at a time until you do not link against the original code at all. The reference blob and your code will both be used by ext2cat, a simple program included with the project that retrieves the content of a file from an ext2 image and prints it to stdout.

By the end of the project you should have a better grasp of the implementation and working of filesystems, in particular the ext2 filesystem.
